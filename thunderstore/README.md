# Summary
This mod changes the stonecutter bench to require bronze instead of iron.

I find that the bronze age is when I want to settle down and build my first grand home.  I like to build on top of stone floors but that means waiting until much later or rushing through the first half of the game.

And so, this mod makes only one small change: it replaces the two iron bars in your stonecutter bench with two bronze bars.  Enjoy!

# Installation
Extract the .dll file to your Valheim\BepInEx\plugins\ folder, just like you do with every other mod.
